		# Rimworld mod - Hardcore Storytellers

		Hardcore Storytellers

		I made this mod for myself, but i am relasing it for anyone who wants a harder rimworld.

		This is a small mod that add 2 new storytellers to the game. Both are quite similar, varying mainly in the amount of incidents/raids they will generate.

		Dallan is the "easier" one, but still, he will generate about 1 raid/day and a bunch of incidents.

		Serena, in the other hand, is an inpatient demon who only seek destruction. She will flood you with raids, sometimes, not even waiting one wave to finish before sending the next one.

		Both are REALLY hard because they give you little to none breathing time.
		Those storytellers will try to generate more orbital trades, but i not sure if this aspect is working properly.

		The art used for both storytellers was taken for other mods.
		Dallan Image come from wave survival mode:
